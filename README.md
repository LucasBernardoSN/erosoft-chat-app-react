## About The Project


This is a simple chat application built with React and Firebase. 

It was done while I learned React in practice when I worked at Erosoft.

It was created using the `create-react-app` template and not used TypeScript, because at that time I was not yet aware of.

For stylization it was used `Tailwindcss` and for the database the `Firebase` was used.

### Built With

* [![React][react-shield]](https://reactjs.org/)
* [![tailwindcss-shield]](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [![firebase-shield]](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Usage

This project is an embryo of a chat that could be used within the company for communication between employees, support and customers.

This is one of the first versions of the project, so it doesn't have many features, but you can see what the chat would look like.
